=== Task 2: Godot Preview Strategy Spike ===

APPROACH A: Godot as Child Process
Status: ✅ CHOSEN
- Simplest implementation
- Native performance
- No CORS/SharedArrayBuffer issues
- Startup: 500-1000ms
- Memory: 150-200MB

APPROACH B: Godot HTML5 in Iframe
Status: ❌ BLOCKED
- Requires COOP/COEP headers
- Electron file:// protocol doesn't support easily
- Export latency: 5-10s
- WASM performance overhead

APPROACH C: Godot HTML5 in BrowserWindow
Status: ⚠️ VIABLE (but not chosen)
- Similar to Approach A but with export overhead
- More complex than Approach A
- No clear advantage

DECISION: Approach A (Child Process)
- Best balance of simplicity, performance, and reliability
- Acceptable UX trade-off (separate window)
- Future: LibGodot for true embedding (Godot 4.5+)
